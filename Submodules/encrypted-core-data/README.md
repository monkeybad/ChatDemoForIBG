# Encrypted Core Data SQLite Store

Core Data encrypted SQLite store using [SQLCipher](http://sqlcipher.net). Use this security control to encrypt data stored in Core Data with SQLite by leveraging the great work at SQLCipher. With this control one no longer has to translate each query result in/out of data models.

# Vulnerabilities Addressed

1. SQLite database is not encrypted, contents are in plain text
  - CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
2. SQLite database file protected with 4 digit system passcode
  - CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
  - SRG-APP-000129-MAPP-000029  Severity-CAT II: The mobile application must implement automated mechanisms to enforce access control restrictions which are not provided by the operating system

# Caveat
This library is a work in progress and will probably not work in every case or with highly complex models. There is also what I believe to be a bug in the implementation of `NSIncrementalStoreNode` and its use through the Core Data framework. I have an open DTS ticket with Apple and am working on this. The issue can be seen by changing the value of and searching for `USE_CUSTOM_NODE_CACHE` in `CMDEncryptedSQLiteStore.m`.

# Project Setup

Add this repository as a submodule to your project.

    git submodule add https://github.com/calebmdavenport/encrypted-core-data.git vendor/encrypted-core-data
    git submodule update --init --recursive

## Configure OpenSSL Source for Xcode

- Download the OpenSSL source code from <http://www.openssl.org/source/>. This has been tested against `1.0.1c`.
- Untar the source and place in a known location.
- Add a new source tree in Xcode > Preferences > Locations > Source Trees called `OPENSSL_SRC` pointing to the OpenSSL source folder.

## Build the OpenSSL and SQLCipher Libraries

Add the Xcode projects found in `vendor/encrypted-core-data/vendor/sqlcipher` and `vendor/encrypted-core-data/vendor/openssl` as subprojects to your Xcode project.

Add the source files found in `vendor/encrypted-core-data/Incremental Store` to your Xcode project. Pick the appropriate targets and uncheck "copy files".

Add the `crypto` and `sqlcipher` libraries as dependencies and linked libraries to all appropriate targets.

Add the flag `-DSQLITE_HAS_CODEC` to all configurations of all appropriate targets

# Using CMDEncryptedSQLiteStore

`CMDEncryptedSQLiteStore` is a subclass of `NSIncrementalStore` that enables communication between CoreData and an SQLCipher encrypted database. It registers itself at runtime so you do not have to call `registerStoreClass:forStoreType:` on `NSPersistentStoreCoordinator`.

Using it is easy. Just set the appropriate type and a database key when you load your persistent store:

```objc
NSDictionary *options = @{ CMDEncryptedSQLiteStorePassphraseKey : @"DB_KEY_HERE" };
NSPersistentStore *store = [coordinator
                            addPersistentStoreWithType:CMDEncryptedSQLiteStoreType
                            configuration:nil
                            URL:databaseURL
                            options:options
                            error:&error];
```

# Debugging

`CMDEncryptedSQLiteStore` responds to the standard CoreData SQL debug flag. Add `-com.apple.CoreData.SQLDebug 1` as an argument to the "run" phase of your scheme to see all generated statements logged to the console.

# Improvements

This project has several areas that could be improved (in order of preference):

- **Migrations** The store currently supports a very small subset of lightweight migrations with inferred migration maps (changing columns, adding and removing whole objects). I would like to implement more migration map parsing.
- **Relationships** I currently only support one-to-many relationships. Work needs to be done in order to support many-to-many and one-to-one.
- **Inheritance** Table inheritance is not really supported or tested at this time.
- **More Test Cases** I built several test cases that helped find bugs and improve support for things like relationships. These cases currently do not touch every feature supported by the store.
- **Persistent Store Options** You have the option to pass a number of options when adding a new store a coordinator. I added my own option which provides the database key but would like to support system options as well. Things like data protection class, SQLite pragmas, and migration options would be nice to have.
